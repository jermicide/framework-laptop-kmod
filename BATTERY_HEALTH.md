For batteries that are continually plugged in, the cycling range does make a difference to battery longevity. Narrower cycling ranges (75-80%):

Puts less stress on the battery chemistry
Significantly reduces calendar aging effects
Minimizes electrode expansion/contraction
May extend overall battery lifespan more effectively
Provides less usable runtime when on battery power

Wider cycling ranges (20-90%):

Offers much more usable capacity when unplugged
Still avoids the most damaging high-state-of-charge regions (90-100%)
Allows the battery to be exercised more fully
May prevent issues related to battery memory effect
Causes more wear over time than narrower ranges

For a laptop that stays plugged in most of the time, research generally suggests that maintaining a moderate-to-narrow charge range in the middle capacity (around 40-80%) tends to be optimal for long-term battery health. However, if you occasionally need to use the laptop away from power for extended periods, a wider range gives you more runtime when needed.
The 75-80% range is extremely conservative and would maximize battery longevity, but at the cost of having very little battery runtime available. A middle-ground approach like 50-80% might offer a better balance for most users - still protecting the battery while providing reasonable runtime when needed.
